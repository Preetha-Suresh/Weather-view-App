# Weather-view-App - Real-Time Weather Forecast with React.js and Bootstrap

**Weather App** is a real-time weather forecasting application built using **React.js** and styled with **Bootstrap**. It allows users to search for weather details of any city across the world. The app provides key weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather status (e.g. cloudy, rainy) for a better understanding of current conditions.

## Features
- **Search for any City**: Quickly search for the weather by city name.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: View current weather conditions, including:
  - **Temperature** (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
  - **Humidity** (percentage)
  - **Wind Speed** (in km/h or mph)
  - **Weather Status** (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A modern, intuitive design powered by **Bootstrap**.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: For building the dynamic, interactive user interface.
  - **Bootstrap**: For creating a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **API Integration**: Integrated with a **Weather API** to fetch real-time weather data.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
